## Hectane

> **Note:** this version of Hectane is still in development and _should not_ be used in production.

### Build Requirements

To build Hectane, you must have the following tools installed:

- GNU Make (or equivalent)
- Docker

The binary is built in a Docker container, so there is no need to worry about build dependencies, such as the Go toolchain or NPM.
